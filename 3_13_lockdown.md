#### 11. Lockdown

*The terminal was already running when your crew found it. Someone started a data transfer and didn't finish. The progress bar crawls forward. Whatever it's downloading, three other crews want it stopped.*

Defender places 1 terminal at center.

`Interact` adjacent to advance progress (1 step per success). The terminal needs 3 steps to complete. Both sides track progress separately. Opponent can `Interact` to reset your progress by 1 step (minimum 0). Hostiles within 1" of the terminal at round end reset both sides by 1 step.

`Engaged` models cannot use the terminal.

**Victory:** First to complete 3 steps. If neither completes, most steps at game end. Tied: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Lead` per step completed. Loser gains 1 `Lead` if they completed at least 1 step.
