#### 2. Control

*The relay hub routes half the sector's traffic. Hold it and you control the flow. Lose it and you lose everything downstream.*

No markers. At game end, count models within 3" of board center. `Out of Action` and `Fleeing` models do not count. Hostiles within 3" of center count against both players (subtract from each total).

If both totals reach 0 or below after hostile subtraction, most surviving models on the board wins.

**Victory:** Side with more models within 3" of center at game end.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Lead`.
