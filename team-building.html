<p>The Departments have discovered something: collaboration works. Not between Departments, of course. Between contractors. Field operations run smoother when expendable assets coordinate. Fewer replacement costs. Higher retrieval rates. Better quarterly projections. Human Capital ran a pilot program. The survivors reported improved outcomes.</p>
<p>Solo contractors work alone. One operative, full authority, zero witnesses. The Departments use solo assets for sensitive extractions. Deniability increases. Collateral decreases. Subscription costs drop when you only have to pay one survivor.</p>
<p>The Mercenary Registry predates the current Department structure. Eight specialists maintained by Revenue Operations. They cost nothing upfront. They take percentages. They die permanently. Replacements are expensive. They unlock sequentially. The Registry controls the pipeline.</p>

<p>You against the Complex. No backup. No second opinions. Standard warband (1 <code>Boss</code>, 4 <code>Resources</code>), standard objectives, hostile opposition on every front.</p>
<h2 id="activation-tokens">Activation Tokens</h2>
<p>Solo play uses the standard activation bag with one modification: hostiles activate individually rather than as groups.</p>
<p><strong>Your Warband</strong>: Add 1 token per model (5 tokens total).</p>
<p><strong>Hostiles</strong>: Add 1 token per hostile model. Each hostile has its own token in the bag.</p>
<h2 id="token-removal">Token Removal</h2>
<p>Remove tokens for <code>Out of Action</code> models at the start of the next round. A model that goes <code>Out of Action</code> mid-round may still have its token drawn (skip the activation).</p>

<h2 id="hostile-behavior">Hostile Behavior</h2>
<p>Hostiles use behavior tables from Inhuman Resources. Each hostile activates independently when its token is drawn.</p>

<h2 id="mercenary-ladder-optional">Mercenary Ladder (Optional)</h2>
<p>The Departments maintain a registry of independent contractors. Not freelancers. Specialists. They cost nothing to hire. They take a percentage of everything you recover. They do not gain experience. They already know everything worth knowing. They cannot be fired. They never formally joined.</p>
<p>When they die, they stay dead. The registry updates. The next name becomes available. Revenue Operations controls the pipeline. They always have another name ready.</p>
<h2 id="hiring-rules">Hiring Rules</h2>
<p><strong>Timing</strong>: Hire between missions only.</p>
<p><strong>Limit</strong>: 1 mercenary per squad.</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Free. Mercenaries take their cut directly from mission payouts.</p>
<p><strong>Roster Slot</strong>: Mercenaries count against your personnel limit. A squad with a mercenary has 4 regular models plus 1 mercenary.</p>
<div class="column-break"></div>

<h2 id="the-ladder">The Ladder</h2>
<p>Mercenaries unlock in sequence. You start with access to the first mercenary on the ladder. When that mercenary dies, the next one becomes available.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hire the first available mercenary (or choose not to hire)</li>
<li>When your current mercenary goes <code>Out of Action</code>, they die</li>
<li>The next mercenary on the ladder becomes available</li>
<li>Repeat until all eight are dead</li>
</ol>
<p>Once all eight mercenaries are dead, no more are available for that campaign. Use them wisely.</p>
<h2 id="mercenary-rules">Mercenary Rules</h2>
<p><strong>No Experience</strong>: Mercenaries do not earn Merits. They cannot be promoted.</p>
<p><strong>No Injuries</strong>: If they go <code>Out of Action</code>, they die. No recovery roll.</p>
<p><strong>Cannot Be Fired</strong>: Mercenaries leave when they die. Not before.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed Loadout</strong>: Equipment cannot be changed, sold, or transferred.</p>
<h2 id="mode-compatibility">Mode Compatibility</h2>
<p>Mercenaries work in all modes. In cooperative play, the team shares the mercenary ladder. In versus play with hostiles, each warband has its own ladder.</p>

<h2 id="the-intern">The Intern</h2>
<p>Fresh from the training division. Eager, expendable, easily replaced. The Departments always have more where this one came from. Human Capital cycles through Interns faster than subscription notices. Most don't survive orientation. The ones who make it to field deployment have already learned the essential lesson: nobody is coming to help.</p>
<p>Standard-issue equipment. Requisitions won't authorize anything better. Orders followed without question. Deviation means termination. Expendability breeds caution. When one dies, another identical face appears in the roster. The Departments call this efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="escalation">Escalation</h2>
<p>The Complex learns. Hostiles adapt to repeated contractor incursions. Survival breeds resistance.</p>
<p>Track campaign victories. After every 3 victories, hostiles escalate:</p>
<table>

<p>Escalation is cumulative. At 9 victories, hostiles have all three bonuses.</p>

<h2 id="campaign-finale-the-source">Campaign Finale: The Source</h2>
<p>At 9 <code>Evidence</code>, the first warband to arrive decides: one more mission for standard victory at 10, or risk everything on extraction now. The signal led here. Six hundred years of sealed doors in the deepest Roots. The Departments sent teams before. None returned. Now you know what they buried.</p>
<p>The Source broadcasts on frequencies that predate the Complex. Predate the Tethering. Predate everything the Departments built their authority on. Carry it out and the Departments lose control. Carry it out and someone finally knows the truth.</p>
<h4 id="terrain">Terrain</h4>
<p>The Roots. Collapsed infrastructure, emergency lighting. Debris blocks direct paths.</p>
<h4 id="deployment">Deployment</h4>
<p><strong>Extractor:</strong> One model holds the Source. Deploys within 6" of one table edge.</p>
<p><strong>Interceptor:</strong> Deploys within 6" of the opposite table edge. In solo or cooperative play, leave empty.</p>
<p><strong>Hostiles:</strong> <code>Elite</code> spawn at table center after deployment.</p>
<h4 id="threats">Threats</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Round 2+:</strong> <code>Normal</code> spawns from Extractor's deployment edge</li>
<li><strong>Round 4+:</strong> <code>Elite</code> spawns from exit edge</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-source">The Source</h4>
<p>Model holding the Source suffers <code>-1 DT</code> to <code>Wits</code>, and cannot use Broadcast Powers.</p>
<p>If holder goes <code>Out of Action</code>, any model within 1" picks it up (<code>Interact</code>). Otherwise, it drops in place.</p>
<p><strong>Detonation:</strong> At game end, the Source explodes. All models within 3" take d6 damage (ignores armor).</p>
<p><strong>Extraction:</strong> Extractor exits the opposite table edge with the Source. Campaign victory.</p>
<p><strong>Interception:</strong> Interceptor holds the Source at game end or eliminates all Extractor models. Extractor loses d6 <code>Evidence</code> and all <code>Leads</code>. Interceptor captures the Source. At 9 <code>Evidence</code>, the Source holder becomes Extractor.</p>
<p><strong>Failure:</strong> Source lost to hostiles or no friendly models remain. Lose d6 <code>Evidence</code> and all <code>Leads</code>. The Departments bury the signal. Again.</p>
