#### 3. Quadrants

*A cascade blew out four sub-sectors at once. Each one holds salvage, intel, or both. Spread thin and claim what you can before the other crew does.*

No markers. Divide the board into 4 equal quadrants. At game end, a quadrant is held by the side with more models inside it. Empty or tied quadrants are not held. Model on a quadrant line: controlling player chooses which quadrant it counts for.

`Fleeing` models do not count. Each hostile in a quadrant subtracts 1 from both players' counts there.

**Victory:** Side holding more quadrants at game end. Tied on quadrants: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains +2 subs per quadrant held.
