#### 6. Breakthrough

*The corridor is collapsing behind both crews. There is no going back. Get your people to the far exit. Anyone left behind stays behind.*

No markers. A model reaching the opponent's deployment edge can exit as part of its move. Exited models are removed and cannot return. `Engaged` models cannot exit (must `Disengage` first).

Hostiles cannot exit. Models that `Flee` off the opponent's edge count as exited. Models that `Flee` off any other edge do not.

If no models exit by game end, most surviving models wins.

**Victory:** Most models exited at game end. Models still on the board do not count. Tied: most surviving models on the board.

**Reward:** Winner gains +2 subs per model exited.
