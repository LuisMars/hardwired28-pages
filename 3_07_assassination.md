#### 5. Assassination

*Someone on the other crew has a price on their head. The contract is specific: one target, no collateral billing. Find them in the chaos.*

After deployment, each player secretly writes down one opposing model as their target. Do not reveal targets until one is taken `Out of Action` or `Flees`. You cannot choose a model that is not on the board.

If the target `Flees`, reveal it immediately: the opponent wins. If both targets fall in the same round, the first to fall loses. Same activation: most surviving models.

**Victory:** First to take their target `Out of Action` (or force them to `Flee`). If neither target falls by game end, reveal both. Most surviving models.

**Reward:** The model that killed the target gains +2 `Merits`.
