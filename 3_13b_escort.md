#### 12. Escort

*They found her hiding in a cable junction, muttering frequencies that haven't been licensed in centuries. She knows where the signal comes from. Both Departments want her talking. She won't last long out here alone.*

Defender places 1 informant at center.

`Interact` adjacent to take control. Escorting model moves at half `Move` (round down). If the escort goes `Out of Action`, the informant stays in place. Any model can take over with `Interact`. `Engaged` models cannot escort. The informant cannot be targeted directly. Hostiles ignore the informant.

If the informant is unescorted at round end and any hostile is within 3", remove the informant. Both sides lose.

**Victory:** Exit the informant off your deployment edge. Game end: side controlling the informant wins. No controller: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Evidence`. Loser gains 1 `Lead` if they controlled the informant at any point.
