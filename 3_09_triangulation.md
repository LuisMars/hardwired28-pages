#### 7. Triangulation

*Three signal repeaters sit dead across the junction. Each one needs manual activation. The crew that brings them online first gets the broadcast frequency. The other gets static.*

Defender places 3 signal markers (6"+ apart, 3"+ from table edges).

`Interact` adjacent to activate a marker for your side. Each model can only activate the same marker once. `Engaged` models cannot activate markers. Activations are permanent: the opponent's activation does not remove yours. Both sides can activate all 3.

Hostiles ignore signal markers.

**Victory:** Most markers activated at game end. Maximum 3 per side. Tied: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Lead` per marker activated.
