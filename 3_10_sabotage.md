#### 8. Sabotage

*Your target is the enemy's power conduit. Their target is yours. Cutting takes precision and time. Defending takes bodies.*

Each player places 1 conduit marker in the opponent's board half (3"+ from table edges).

`Interact` adjacent to sever the enemy conduit. Severing requires 2 `Interact` actions on the same conduit (not necessarily the same activation or model). Mark the first with a token. `Engaged` models cannot sever conduits. If no friendly model is within 1" of the conduit at the start of your next `Interact`, progress resets. Severing is permanent.

Hostiles ignore conduits.

**Victory:** First to sever. Both sever same round: first to complete wins. Neither severs by game end: most surviving models.

**Reward:** The loser's squad loses 5 subs.
