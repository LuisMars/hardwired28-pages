#### 9. Heist

*A corporate terminal sits unguarded between the crews. Its databanks hold encrypted Department files. Both sides can pull data. Neither can lock the other out.*

Defender places 1 terminal at center.

`Interact` adjacent to download. Each download costs one action. Only one model per side can download per round. `Engaged` models cannot use the terminal. Downloads are tracked per player: both sides use the same terminal.

If a hostile ends its activation within 1" of the terminal, the side with more downloads loses 1 (tied: both lose 1, minimum 0).

**Victory:** First to 3 downloads. If neither reaches 3, most downloads at game end. Tied: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Lead` per download. Loser gains 1 `Lead` if they completed at least 1 download.
