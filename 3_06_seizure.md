#### 4. Seizure

*A portable beacon pulses with cached data in the corridor junction. Hold it long enough and the data is yours. Lose focus and the other crew takes the feed.*

Defender places 1 beacon at center.

At the end of each round, count models within 3" of the beacon. `Out of Action` and `Fleeing` models do not count. Each hostile within 3" subtracts 1 from both players' counts. The side with more scores 1 point. Tied or both at 0: no one scores.

Tied on points at game end: side with more models within 3" of the beacon wins. Still tied: most surviving models.

**Victory:** Most points at game end.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Lead` per 2 points scored (round down, minimum 1).
