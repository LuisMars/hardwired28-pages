#### 10. Uplink

*Three relay nodes form a local network across the junction. Hold the nodes and the data flows your way. Let the enemy contest them and nobody gets anything.*

Defender places 3 relay nodes (6"+ apart, 3"+ from table edges).

At game end, a node is live for your side if you have at least one model within 3" and the opponent does not. Contested nodes (both sides present) are not live for either. `Out of Action` and `Fleeing` models do not count.

Hostiles within 3" of a node contest it for both sides.

**Victory:** Most live nodes at game end. Tied: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains 1 `Lead` + 1 `Lead` per live node.
