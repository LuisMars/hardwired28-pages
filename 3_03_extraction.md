## Missions

#### 1. Extraction

*A data-slate surfaced in a dead drop near Junction Null. Both crews got the tip. The slate holds Department records worth more than anyone here earns in a cycle.*

Defender places 1 objective marker at center.

`Interact` adjacent to pick up the objective. The carrier moves at half `Move` (round down) and cannot `Disengage`. Drop the objective if the carrier goes `Out of Action` or `Flees` (place where they fell or at the board edge). `Engaged` models cannot pick up the objective. Any model can pick it up again with `Interact`.

Hostiles ignore the objective.

**Victory:** Carry the objective off your deployment edge. If neither side extracts by game end, the side holding the objective wins. No holder: most surviving models.

**Reward:** Winner gains +5 subs.
